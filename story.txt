Upon a time there was a man named Zach who had no clue how to use linux
And he learned how to do that in an hour...which is totally great!! He seems to be a really quick learner! Wonder what other amazing stuff he wants to learn...
That is great. There is a lot of cool cs technology waiting for you.

He should try using Nautilus. It's so cool that graphical applications can be run on your own computer through remote connections!
